            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>The US Department of Education website is an important resource for educators, parents, and especially children, but these users don’t gain any benefit from a website that is difficult to use. If the users can’t find or access the information they need, they can get frustrated or even miss opportunities for learning about educational resources and funding.</p>
            <p>I analyzed and annotated the following pages from the website: Home, About, 1098 & Tax Forms, Every Student Succeeds Act, Betsy DeVos, Press Releases, Student Loans & Forgiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid content-section">            
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>I also interviewed a few users to get a sense of how different people interact with the site. My own site analysis, coupled with this user research, led to the following insights:</p>
            <p>The site is resource-heavy but <b>lacks an intuitive information architecture</b> for users to find what they need. The <b>search bar provides no suggestions</b> or help for those who aren’t sure what they should search for. The alternative is to browse the homepage to find the correct information. Unfortunately, the homepage is covered with text that is mostly the same size and color. This <b>lack of hierarchy and readability</b> makes it very difficult for users to navigate the site.</p>
            <p>Aside from the poor information architecture, the Dept of Education website is ultimately dated and has a <b>“boring government” look and feel.</b> I wanted to redesign this site to make it a more <b>useful and delightful resource</b> for the educators, parents, and young minds it strives to help. Government websites often have the reputation of being old, dull, and no-frills, but that doesn’t mean they have to be depressing or unusable.</p>
            <p>With these initial findings in hand, I organized my thoughts in an affinity diagram and created user personas.</p>
            <div class="img-container-medium">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="images/doed-affinity.png" alt="Affinity Diagram">

        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid content-section">
            <h4>User Personas</h4>
            <p>I made two user personas to represent the two main types of users that would be navigating the Dept of Education website: a teacher and a parent. These user personas helped me reflect on the needs and challenges of the user, in order to ideate possible solutions for redesigning the information architecture.</p>

        <div class="container-fluid content-section">
            <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
            <p>Looking more closely at the existing website with my users in mind, I performed a heuristic evaluation and did a task analysis of the search process. Overall, the site was <b>not intuitive</b> to use and looked <b>dated</b>. Upon closer inspection, I found that the <b>menu was confusing</b> and the only way to know what a link meant was to click on it, thereby navigating to your destination through trial and error. The site was very <b>text-heavy</b> and hierarchy was not clear. There were several sections of links on the page, but with <b>no indication of where the user should look first</b> or how they should use the page. I kept these insights in mind when thinking about how to redesign the navigation and site structure.</p>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
            <h4>IA Card Sorting</h4>
            <p>The existing website had a lot of links in disjointed sections and menus, so I used card sorting to reorganize the links in a more intuitive way.</p>
            <p>Many of the headers had unclear titles, making it hard to predict what could be found in each menu item. Using Trello, I sectioned all 53 links into six main categories and renamed them using more user-friendly language. I predicted that certain categories would have more traffic than others, so the next step was to lay out the site and make sure all the information could be displayed in a clear and simple way.</p>

            <h4>Style Guide</h4>
            <p>I identified the brand voice of the Department of Education and created a style guide to direct my UI design decisions.</p>
            <p>I chose a color palette that is pleasing and easy to look at, so that users will enjoy searching for what they need, despite preconceived feelings of frustration that they may have. It also evokes a youthful feeling, since the Department of Education is committed to the nation's children. The design is simple and intuitive so that users of all ages and backgrounds can find what they're looking for without confusion.</p>

The existing hierarchies were hard to understand, and the users I interviewed had a hard time finding things or knowing where to start.

                        <p>The current Department of Education site is ugly on desktop, but almost unusable on mobile. In a time when almost every adult owns a smart phone and internet traffic is increasingly mobile-heavy, it is imperative that all sites are responsive. I made sure my design translated to mobile easily and intuitively, and created a few iPad screens as well. I also made sure to test these designs on the proper-sized screens to check font and button sizes.</p>

                        <h4>Changes to Style Guide</h4>
                        <p>I created the style guide before I started designing the hi-fi mockups, and while it provided good direction for me when designing, I realized that I wanted to make some changes to the elements as I was designing. Certain things needed to be a different size, looked better with slightly different spacing, etc. I learned that some style decisions might adapt and change while you work. Creating Components in Adobe XD allowed me to easily change certain elements across all my screens and to test out my changes quickly.</p>
