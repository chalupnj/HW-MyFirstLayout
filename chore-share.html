            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>My partner and I wanted to create an app that would solve an everyday problem. With that vague and ominous notion in mind, we started brainstorming. What are some everyday sources of frustration? There are many, of course, but once we narrowed down the list to those that had no existing obvious solution, we landed on the issue of roommate differences.</p>
            <p>With that bit of direction, we started interviews and sent out a survey to gather data. Our goal when interviewing was to identify pain points between roommates, and we heard a lot of horror stories. We soon learned that cleanliness and housekeeping were the biggest stressors, so our second round of interviews delved deeper into the topics of chore completion and delegation.</p>

            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Everyone we talked to had a bad roommate experience to talk about</li>
                <li>The roommate relationship is delicate</li>
                <li>Confrontation is scary</li>
                <li>Resentment grows over messes and uncooperative roommates</li>
                <li>People feel a lack of control when living with roommates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We organized our feedback into an affinity diagram and analyzed it to find insights. We found that cleanliness, fairness, and harmony (getting along well) were the top concerns people had when living with roommates. Money also came up with regards to splitting household supplies and expenses. We thought this was an interesting secondary pain point, so we kept it in mind as a possible auxiliary feature of the app.</p>

            <h4>Understanding the User</h4>
            <p>People living with roommates need to divide household tasks fairly because although they want to live in a clean house, they are hesitant to confront their roommates about equal division of chores.</p>
            <p>We identified that users needed three main things: a clean place to live, a good relationship with their roommates, and a fair division of tasks.</p>

            <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
            <p>We took a look at the current market and found that there were several chore splitting apps, but only one for roommates (which didn’t offer incentives). We saw our opportunity for offering an app that allows roommates to divide chores and also uses rewards to motivate them to participate.</p>

            <h4>User Flow</h4>
            <p>We prioritized features for our app and mapped them out in a user flow.</p>
            <p>In the onboarding process, the user can either create a new household or join an existing one. The app takes new users through an interactive quiz to determine their preferences and their household’s habits. It uses this data to equally assign chores to each roommate so the user doesn’t have to delegate.</p>
            <p>From the Chores page, users can see all chores and who they are assigned to. They can also edit chores, swap chores with other roommates, and verify that chores have been completed after their roommates mark them “done.”</p>
            <p>Users are motivated to download the app and complete their chores on time by rewards, which they can trade in through the app for discounts to popular stores. In the User Profile page, users can access these rewards. They can also view all of their own tasks and have the ability to swap chores with their roommates.</p>
            <p>In the Household page, users can view and edit details about their household. They can also add/remove roommates or reassign chores.</p>

                <li>Add chronological hierarchy on chore screen</li>

                        We added a user account so that the user isn’t permanently attached to their household; they can use the app with different households, without losing their personal history and rewards.

                        <h4>Too Many Ideas!</h4>
                        <p>Something we struggled with at the beginning of this project was that we had too many ideas for features that we wanted to include in the app. With more time, we might be able to build out more features, but it is also important not to bog the user down. Feature prioritization matrices were helpful in narrowing down the things we wanted to focus on designing, and we knew that we would be able to do fewer things better than if we attempted to tackle too much.</p>

                        <h4>User Flows Save Time</h4>
                        <p>Although creating a detailed and complete user flow can take a lot of time up front, I found that it is essential to do so in order to save time later when designing. We iterated on our user flow, focusing in on each segment and then tying it together to create a cohesive user flow with no dead ends. This helped immensely when designing each screen; I could easily tell what I needed to create, how many screens it would take, and where it needed to connect to in the prototype.</p>

                        <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                        <p>For this project, we chose to focus on the user persona of a young millennial living with roommates, but through our research we found that there is a much larger group that would have use for this app. We’d love to extend the use case to families, especially families with young children who are teaching their kids responsibility. Children are highly motivated by rewards, so the infrastructure of our app would translate well to the family household.</p>
                                
                        <!-- Since we didn’t actually monetize our app, we didn’t fully flesh out the business side of things. If we were to send ChoreShare to market, we’d want to partner with popular stores or household brands in order to get discounts and coupons to use as incentives. We could monetize the app by helping market certain brands and gather user shopping trends, in return for discounts that we pass along to users. -->
