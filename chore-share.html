            <h3>Empathize</h3>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>My partner and I wanted to create an app that would solve an everyday problem. We started brainstorming. What are some everyday sources of frustration? Eventually, we landed on the issue of roommate differences.</p>
            <p>We started interviews and sent out a survey to gather data. Our goal when interviewing was to identify pain points between roommates, and we heard a lot of horror stories. We soon learned that differences in cleanliness standards and housekeeping expectations were the biggest stressors, so our second round of interviews delved deeper into the topics of chore completion and delegation.</p>

            <p>&bull; Everyone we talked to had a bad roommate experience to talk about</p>

            <p>&bull; Confrontation is scary</p>
            <p>&bull; Resentment grows over messes and uncooperative roommates</p>

            <h4>Affinity Diagram</h4>
            <p>We organized our feedback into an affinity diagram and analyzed it to find insights. We found that cleanliness, fairness, and harmony (getting along well) were the top concerns people had when living with roommates. Money also came up with regards to splitting household supplies and expenses. We thought this was an interesting secondary pain point, so we kept it in mind as a possible auxiliary feature of the app.</p>

            <h4>Understanding the User</h4>
            <p>People living with roommates need to divide household tasks fairly because although they want to live in a clean house, they are hesitant to confront their roommates about equal division of chores.</p>
            <p>We identified that users needed three main things: a clean place to live, a good relationship with their roommates, and a fair division of tasks.</p>

            <p>We took a look at the current market and found that there were several chore splitting apps, but only one was targeted at roommates (and it didn’t offer incentives). We saw our opportunity to offer an app that allows roommates to divide chores and also uses rewards to motivate them to participate.</p>

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <h4>User Flows</h4>
            <p>We prioritized features for our app and mapped them out in a user flow.</p>
            <p>In the <b>onboarding</b> process, the user can either create a new household or join an existing one. The app takes new users through an interactive <b>chore assignment</b> quiz to determine their preferences and their household’s habits. It uses this data to equally assign chores to each roommate so the user doesn’t have to delegate.</p>
            <p>From the <b>Chores</b> screen, users can see all chores and to whom they are assigned. They can also edit chores, swap chores with other roommates, and verify that chores have been completed after their roommates mark them “done.”</p>
            <p>On the <b>Household</b> screen, users can view and edit details about their household. They can also add/remove roommates or reassign chores.</p>
            <p>Users are motivated to download the app and complete their chores on time with rewards, which they can trade in through the app for discounts to popular stores. On the <b>User Profile</b> screen, users can access these rewards. They can also view all of their own tasks and have the ability to swap chores with their roommates.</p>

            <p>As the primary UI designer for this project, I created a style tile to guide the visual design of our app. This small-scale style guide defined some of the colors, components, and typography, and was helpful in building out high-fidelity mockups of a few screens.</p>

                        <h4>Too Many Ideas!</h4>
                        <p>Something we struggled with at the beginning of this project was that we had too many ideas for features that we wanted to include in the app. With more time, we might be able to build out more features, but it is also important not to bog the user down. Feature prioritization matrices were helpful in narrowing down the things we wanted to focus on designing, and we knew that we would be able to do fewer things better than if we attempted to tackle too much.</p>

                        <p>Although creating a detailed and complete user flow can take a lot of time up front, I found that it is essential to do so in order to save time later when designing. We iterated on our user flow, focusing in on each segment and then tying it together to create a cohesive user flow with no dead ends. This helped immensely when designing each screen; I could easily tell what I needed to create, how many screens it would take, and where it needed to connect to in the prototype.</p>

                        <p>For this project, we chose to focus on the user persona of a young millennial living with roommates, but through our research we found that there is a much larger group that would have use for this app. We’d love to extend the use case to families, especially families with young children who are teaching their kids responsibility. Children are highly motivated by rewards, so the infrastructure of our app would translate well to the family household.</p>
                                
                        <!-- Since we didn’t actually monetize our app, we didn’t fully flesh out the business side of things. If we were to send ChoreShare to market, we’d want to partner with popular stores or household brands in order to get discounts and coupons to use as incentives. We could monetize the app by helping market certain brands and gather user shopping trends, in return for discounts that we pass along to users. -->
