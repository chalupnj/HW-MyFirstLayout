            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>I started with the idea that I would improve an aspect of the travel experience. I was especially interested in the topics of budgeting and packing. The first step was to perform some interviews to determine what the pain points were around these topics.</p>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>A few insights I discovered from my initial interviews:</p>
                    <p>&bull; Being ill-prepared before a trip causes more stress during the actual vacation</p>
                    <p>&bull; EVERYONE forgets to pack things</p>
                    <p>&bull; It is frustrating when there is no room for gifts and souvenirs</p>
                    <p>&bull; Most often forgotten items are everyday items: chargers, toothbrushes, etc.</p>
                    <p>&bull; It’s hard to predict the weather when packing</p>
                    <p>&bull; Packing is very time-consuming</p>
            <br />
            <p>I organized my key takeaways from each interview and analyzed the results in an affinity diagram. I found that forgetting to pack items was the most prominent pain point. Many users also mentioned stress and weather, so I decided to keep those as secondary goals in my app design.</p>

            <p>From there, I created a user persona based on my interviews and survey data.</p>

            <h4>Storyboard</h4>
            <p>Thinking about how the average user might need an app like the one I proposed, I drew a storyboard that follows the user through a typical use case.</p>

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <h4>Feature Prioritization</h4>
            <p>After identifying what users would need in a packing app, I brainstormed some features and prioritized them in a matrix.</p>
            <p>The backbone of the app is a checklist, so that was essential. Every single person I talked to mentioned checking the weather as part of their packing ritual, so I included an in-app weather feature. Another top priority was reminders so that users wouldn’t forget to pack anything.</p>

            <h4>Splash Screen Design Improvements</h4>

                        <h4>Designing for iOS</h4>
                        <p>I’m primarily an Android user myself, and this was one of the first iOS-only projects I did. Usually, if I am designing for Android and iOS, I start with Android and then translate the design to iOS. It was interesting to approach this project from an iOS-first viewpoint. I enjoy keeping up with design trends for a variety of devices, and it is a fun challenge to use a design language or trend that I don't normally gravitate towards. </p>

                        <h4>Software Limitations</h4>
                        <p>Although prototyping software is very helpful, I sometimes wished I could prototype some of the more animated functionalities of my app. InVision and Sketch didn’t meet my expectations in this regard. I think part of app design is the responses the app makes when the user interacts with it, so it would be nice to be able to mock these up in the prototype as well. I would love to continue my work on this project and prototype with a software that allows more animation.</p>

                        <p>This project focused more on the UX research than on visual and UI design, so the next step would be to create hi-fi mockups, and add some animations and microinteractions. I’d like to do another round of testing before finalizing my idea, and eventually make it a real product for the app store. Based on my extensive research and testing, I think many people would find value from Alpacka.</p>
