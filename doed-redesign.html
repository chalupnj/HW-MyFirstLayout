            <h1>User Interface Analysis</h1>
            <h5>The US Department of Education website is an important resource for educators, parents, and especially children, but these users don’t gain any benefit from a website that is difficult to use. If the users can’t find or access the information they need, they can get frustrated or even miss opportunities for learning about educational resources and funding.<h5>
            <br />
            <p>I analyzed and annotated the following pages from the website: Home, About, 1098 & Tax Forms, Every Student Succeeds Act, Betsy DeVos, Press Releases, Student Loans & Forgiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container-fluid content-section">            
            <h1>User Research</h1>
            <h5>I also interviewed a few users to get a sense of how different people interact with the site. My own site analysis, coupled with this user research, led to the following insights:</h5>
            <p>The site is resource-heavy but lacks an information architecture that is intuitive for users to find what they need. There is a search bar, but it provides no suggestions or help for those who aren’t sure what they should search for. The alternative is to browse the homepage to find the correct information. Unfortunately, the homepage is covered with text that is mostly the same size and color. This lack of hierarchy and readability makes it very difficult for users to navigate the site.
            <br /><br />
            Aside from the poor information architecture, the Dept of Education website is ultimately dated and has a “boring government” look and feel. I wanted to redesign this site to make it a more useful and delightful resource for the educators, parents, and young minds it strives to help. Government websites often have the reputation of being old, dull, and no-frills, but that doesn’t mean they have to be depressing or unusable. With these initial findings in hand, I organized my thoughts in an affinity diagram and created user personas.</p>

            <h5>I made two user personas to represent the two main types of users that would be navigating the Dept of Education website: a teacher and a parent.<h5>

            <h1>Heuristic Evaluation</h1>
            <h5>Looking more closely at the existing website with my users in mind, I performed a heuristic evaluation and did a task analysis of the search process. Overall, the site was not intuitive to use and looked dated. Upon closer inspection, I found that the menu was confusing and the only way to know what a link meant was to click on it, thereby navigating to your destination through trial and error. The site was very text-heavy and hierarchy was not clear. There were several sections of links on the page, but with no real indication of where the user should look first or how they should use the page.<h5>
