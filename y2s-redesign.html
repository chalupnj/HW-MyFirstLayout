            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <p>​We interviewed a few users and stakeholders to get a sense of how different people interact with the site. It was valuable to get insights from Youth2Senior's founder, Adelle, who also created the current website, and learn about the most important aspects of the non-profit from her.</p>         
            <h4>Stakeholder Insights</h4>
                <p>&bull; Seniors don’t use the website.</p>
                <p>&bull; It’s for parents to sign their kids up to volunteer.</p>
                <p>&bull; The calendar and registration pages are most important.</p>
                <p>&bull; Nobody tracks their volunteer time.</p>
                <p>&bull; The rewards program is defunct.</p>
                <p>&bull; The website should ideally be fun and engaging, yet professional.</p>

            <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
            <h4>Inspiration Mood Board</h4>
            <p>When thinking about the UI of our redesign, we started by compiling an inspiration board on InVision, to pull together ideas and feelings that we wanted our styles to emulate. Since Youth2Seniors is completely run by volunteers and relies on children to visit the older adults, we wanted the website to appeal to children and their parents. It needed to be fun and engaging enough to attract children, while being professional enough to illustrate to parents that the organization is trustworthy and will provide a valuable experience for their children.</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Style Guide</h4>
            <p>Our style guide was instrumental in applying cohesion and purpose across our designs. We chose a pleasant color palette with some pops of color for CTAs. It pulls in both bright youthful and subdued professional colors. The design is simple and clear, and the major calls to action are prominently highlighted. Youth2Seniors' main goal is to get more volunteers, and we wanted the design to reflect that with few distractions.</p>

            <div class="row">

                        <h4>Redesigning vs Starting from Scratch</h4>
                        <p>Although redesigning an existing website was in some ways easier than creating a completely new product or idea, we did find it difficult to prioritize features that the non-profit already had in place. Based on user interviews, we cut out some features (tracking time, rewards program, etc) that Youth2Seniors no longer uses. If we were to build upon this project, we would investigate why people aren't using those features and solve for the users' current needs. Are people simply not interested? Or are those features just difficult to find and/or use?</p>

                        <p>I loved collaborating with my peers on this project and it was great to have multiple minds working on the problem. One challenge we faced was ensuring that our designs meshed, despite splitting the work among the three of us. We each created a couple pages, so it was imperative that we checked in frequently to make sure we were all designing with the same look and feel. Having a set style guide helped with this as well.</p>

                        <p>As always, we found it extremely valuable to start out doing user interviews. It's always interesting to see how our preconceived notions as designers are proved wrong time and again by the actual users. For example, we originally thought the website redesign should be very fun and kid-friendly. However, through user research we learned that a professional look and feel was most important, so that people would feel comfortable trusting Youth2Seniors with their kids and donation money.</p>
