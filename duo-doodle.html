                    <h6>For my capstone project at Stanford, I worked with a student from Stanford's Graduate School of Education to design and manufacture a toy called Duo Doodle.
                    <br /><br />
                    We conducted user research, prototyped, and iterated on our design to create an art board toy that encourages collaboration between preschool-aged children and teaches conflict resolution. We manufactured Duo Doodle overseas and had a lot of fun testing with children. See our pitch video below, which we used to find a coach to help us develop this product (originally called CollaborPlay).</h6>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>One in 88 children in the US has autism spectrum disorder, and many of these children have neurotypical siblings. Studies have shown that sibling interaction has many benefits for developing children, but autistic children need to learn how to interact with their neurotypical siblings in order to improve their social interactions in and out of the home environment.</p>
            <p>We began our project with the intent of designing a product to help children with autism, but we were unable to find enough children with ASD who were willing to participate in our research and testing. We decided to keep children with autism as a user group, but also opened our research up to all sibling pairs under age 10.</p>
            <p>We interviewed about half a dozen parents of multiple children and talked to their kids as well. This pool of families was instrumental in not only our user research, but our testing and iterating as well. From our initial interviews, we gleaned the following insight:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">Interactive play has lots of proven benefits for both siblings, ASD or not, but it’s hard to get young children motivated to play with their ASD sibling if the ASD child doesn’t give his sibling attention. The most benefit comes from when the ASD child plays with neurotypical children, and such interactions begin within the home (with siblings).

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>During our first brainstorming session, we decided to design a type of block that would be large, foamy, and safe for children with ASD. After visiting and interviewing more families, we found that most families already had blocks of some sort, and didn’t necessarily need more. We brainstormed some more and landed on a transparent, collaborative art board toy.</p>

            <h4>Prototyping</h4>
            <p>I was the sole Product Designer for this project, so I was in charge of all the prototyping and creation of the physical product.</p>
            <p>I made at least 10 prototypes, ranging from low-fi cardboard to machine-milled acrylic to dovetailed wood. Through each iteration, I learned what designs were most sensible and what didn’t work at all. When designing for kids there are certain considerations I had to keep in mind: there couldn’t be any small pieces that could pose a choking hazard; the product had to be sturdy enough to take a beating from a rambunctious child; the toy had to be easy enough for someone with limited fine motor skills and tiny hands to use. Keeping these things in mind, as well as the insights we learned through interviews, I iterated until we landed on a final prototype.</p>

                        <h4>Too Many Ideas!</h4>
                        <p>Something we struggled with at the beginning of this project was that we had too many ideas for features that we wanted to include in the app. With more time, we might be able to build out more features, but it is also important not to bog the user down. Feature prioritization matrices were helpful in narrowing down the things we wanted to focus on designing, and we knew that we would be able to do fewer things better than if we attempted to tackle too much.</p>

                        <p>Although creating a detailed and complete user flow can take a lot of time up front, I found that it is essential to do so in order to save time later when designing. We iterated on our user flow, focusing in on each segment and then tying it together to create a cohesive user flow with no dead ends. This helped immensely when designing each screen; I could easily tell what I needed to create, how many screens it would take, and where it needed to connect to in the prototype.</p>

                        <p>For this project, we chose to focus on the user persona of a young millennial living with roommates, but through our research we found that there is a much larger group that would have use for this app. We’d love to extend the use case to families, especially families with young children who are teaching their kids responsibility. Children are highly motivated by rewards, so the infrastructure of our app would translate well to the family household.</p>
                                
                        <!-- Since we didn’t actually monetize our app, we didn’t fully flesh out the business side of things. If we were to send ChoreShare to market, we’d want to partner with popular stores or household brands in order to get discounts and coupons to use as incentives. We could monetize the app by helping market certain brands and gather user shopping trends, in return for discounts that we pass along to users. -->
